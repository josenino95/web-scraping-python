In this workshop you will learn how to extract data from websites, what you'd call web scraping, using Python. In Episode 1 we begin by reviewing the structure of websites in HTML and how to retrieve information from it using your browser and the `BeautifulSoup` package. In Episode 2 we'll dive deep on how to get the HTML behind any website using the `requests` package and how to parse and find information with `BeautifulSoup`. At the end,youâ€™ll learn about the differences between static and dynamic webpages, and how to scrape the latter with the `Selenium` package.

This workshop is designed for participants who already have a basic understanding of Python programming. In particular, it's best to know how to:

- Install and import packages and modules
- Use lists and dictionaries
- Use conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Use `for` loops
- Calling functions, understanding parameters/arguments and return values
